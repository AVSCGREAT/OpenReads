Looks like current cover archival items on archive.org stop at https://archive.org/details/covers_0006

Interim archived covers presumably live at /1/var/lib/openlibrary/coverstore/items/covers_0007

The files in this directory presumably get manually uploaded to an item called covers_0007 (following naming convention) on Archive.org.

I think the 0007 comes from ???

Current id of latest cover uploaded is 13011172

/1/var/lib/openlibrary/coverstore/localdisk/ is where files are uploaded before archival.
